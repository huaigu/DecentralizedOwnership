# DecentralizedOwnership
Decentralized ownership contract, make fun of the project ATEM which use unofficial contract that everyone can acquire ownership.

Atem use a unofficial Ownable.sol file which lead to anyone can take ownership of contract, user who have ownership can change baseURI, you can image what happened to end user.

# how it work

everyone can pay ```price``` fee to acquire ownership and make some change to this contract, this owership will expired after ```PERIOD```, user can pay ```price``` to extened, owner can share balance of contract, which is 50%(cannt be changed.)
